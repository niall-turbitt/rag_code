# MAGIC # 1. Hello World Driver Notebook
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook demonstrates how to log, test, and deploy a simple "Hello World" chain using Databricks RAG Studio. It covers the following steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Install Databricks RAG Studio
# MAGIC 2. Import required modules
# MAGIC 3. Define path for the chain notebook
# MAGIC 4. Log the chain to MLflow and test it locally
# MAGIC 5. Register the chain as a model in Unity Catalog
# MAGIC 6. Deploy the chain
# MAGIC 7. View the deployed chain in the RAG Studio UI

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Deploy the chain to:
# MAGIC 1. Review App so you & your stakeholders can chat with the chain & given feedback via a web UI.
# MAGIC 2. Chain REST API endpoint to call the chain from your front end.
# MAGIC 3. Feedback REST API endpoint to pass feedback back from your front end.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note:** It can take up to 15 minutes to deploy - we are working to reduce this time to seconds.
