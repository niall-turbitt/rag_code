# Tutorials

**Important: Before you start, open the [`wheel_installer`](M1_Sample_Code/wheel_installer.py) notebook and replace the `PUT_*` placeholders with the URLs you recieved from your Databricks representative.**

```
%pip install --quiet "PUT_RAG_EVAL_SUITE_WHEEL_HERE"
%pip install --quiet "PUT_RAG_STUDIO_WHEEL_HERE"

%pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk databricks-vectorsearch tiktoken langchain langchainhub faiss-cpu -U -q
%pip uninstall mlflow mlflow-skinny -y # uninstall existing mlflow to avoid installation issues
%pip install "PUT_MLFLOW_WHEEL_HERE" -U
%pip install "PUT_MLFLOW_SKINNY_WHEEL_HERE" -U
```

*Note: While stored in the Git repo as `.py` files, these `.py` files are actually Databricks Notebooks - if you import the file using Databricks, it will render as a Notebook in the Notebook editor.  We suggest adding a Git Folder in your Databricks workspace based on a forked copy of this repo.*

## Tutorial 1: Hello world

### Creating a chain
First, let's create the most minimal chain in RAG Studio.  This tutorial will familarize you with the basics of the development workflow and the chain input/output schema.

When using RAG Studio, you create your chain code using LangChain inside a Notebook.  Open the [`hello_world_chain`](M1_Sample_Code/1_hello_world/1_hello_world_chain.py) Notebook, review the commented code, and try running it.

Note: If you need support for Python based chains, please reach out to our team.

### Logging & deploying a chain

Now, let's log this chain to MLflow and deploy it to the Review App.

When using RAG Studio, you create, evaluate, and deploy new versions of your chain using a "Driver" notebook.  For now, let's just log and deploy the chain.  Open the [`1_hello_world_driver_notebook`](M1_Sample_Code/1_hello_world/1_hello_world_driver_notebook.py) Notebook, review the code, and try running it.

If successful, you will be able to chat with your hello world chain in the Review App.

## Tutorial 2: Hello World w/ parameterization

### Parameterizing a chain

RAG Studio supports parameterizing your chains - this allows you to quickly iterate on quality related parameters (such as the prompt or retriever configuruation) while holding the chain's code constant.

Parameterization is based on a YAML file.  Open [`2_hello_world_config.yaml`](M1_Sample_Code/2_hello_world_parameterized/2_hello_world_config.yaml) for an example of the configuration file - the structure of the YAML is up to you, although in the next tutorial, you will see our suggested structure.

Open [`2_hello_world_parameterized_chain`](M1_Sample_Code/2_hello_world_parameterized/2_hello_world_parameterized_chain.py) and [`2_hello_world_parameterized_driver_notebook`](M1_Sample_Code/2_hello_world_parameterized/2_hello_world_parameterized_driver_notebook.py) to see how this works in practice.


How to access configuration settings:
```
############
# Get the configuration YAML
############
rag_config = RagConfig("1_hello_world_config.yaml")
rag_config.get('sample_param')
```

## Tutorial 3: Creating & evaluating a RAG chain

NOw, we will create a simple RAG chain with PDF files from a UC Volume.  

### Create a UC Volume with PDF files

Create a UC Volume and load PDF files.  You can use the PDFs from the directory [`sample_pdfs`](M1_Sample_Code/sample_pdfs/) to get started quickly - these PDFs are a few recent research papers from Matei's lab.

### Create a Vector Index

Open and follow the steps in the notebook [`3_load_pdf_to_vector_index`](M1_Sample_Code/3_pdf_rag/3_load_pdf_to_vector_index.py) to load PDF files from the UC Volume to a Vector Index.  The sample notebook uses the BGE embedding model hosted on FMAPI, but later tutorials show you how to use OpenAI's embedding models.

### Prototype a RAG Chain

1. Take the output from the last cell in the [`3_load_pdf_to_vector_index`](M1_Sample_Code/3_pdf_rag/3_load_pdf_to_vector_index.py) notebook and overwrite the first few lines of the [`3_rag_chain_config.yaml`](M1_Sample_Code/3_pdf_rag/3_rag_chain_config.yaml) configuration so your chain can use the vector index you just created.

2. Open the notebook [`3_rag_chain`](M1_Sample_Code/3_pdf_rag/3_rag_chain.py) and run the code locally to test the chain.  This chain uses the `Databricks-DBRX-Instruct` model hosted on FMAPI.

### Log & evaluate a RAG Chain

To understand the evaluation metrics and LLM judges that are used to evaluate your chain, refer to the [metrics overview](metrics.md).

1. Open the notebook [`3_rag_chain_driver_notebook`](M1_Sample_Code/3_pdf_rag/3_rag_chain_driver_notebook.py) to log, evaluate, and deploy the chain.
2. Share the deployed Review App with your users to interact with the chain and provide feedback.

# Advanced examples & tutorials

## 4. Multi-turn conversation

The chain [`4_rag_chain_w_conversation_history`](M1_Sample_Code/4_rag_chain_w_conversation_history/4_rag_chain_w_conversation_history.py) and [`4_rag_chain_w_conversation_history_config.yaml`](M1_Sample_Code/4_rag_chain_w_conversation_history/4_rag_chain_w_conversation_history_config.yaml) is an example showing you how to enable multi-turn conversation with a query re-writer prompt.  The accompanying driver notebook [`4_rag_chain_w_conversation_history_driver_notebook`](M1_Sample_Code/4_rag_chain_w_conversation_history/4_rag_chain_w_conversation_history_driver_notebook.py) follows the same workflow as the driver notebook from [Tutorial 3](M1_Sample_Code/3_pdf_rag) to log and evaluate this chain.

## 5. Advanced Evaluation
### 5a. Using RAG Evaluation Suite without RAG Studio

If you have a RAG chain that was deployed outside of RAG Studio, you can still use the Evaluation Suite to assess the chain's quality.  See [`5_evaluation_without_rag_studio`](M1_Sample_Code/5_evaluation_without_rag_studio.py) to see how to do this.

### 5b. Improving LLM judge accuracy with few-shot examples

To improve the accuracy of the Databricks judges, you can provide few-shot examples of "good" and "bad" answers for each LLM judge.  Databricks strongly reccomends providing at least 2 postive and 2 negative examples per judge to improve the accuracy.  See the bottom of the notebook [`5_evaluation_without_rag_studio`](M1_Sample_Code/5_evaluation_without_rag_studio.py) for how to do this.  

*Note: Even though this example configuration is included in the non-RAG Studio evaluation example, you can use the example configuration with the RAG Studio evaluation tutorials above.*

## 6. Review user feedback from the Review App

You can use the human feedback collected using the Review App to:
- Determine where you chain is working well and/or not working
- Curate an evaluation set for offline evaluation
- Fine tune a generation or embedding model to improve quality

All deployed models from RAG Studio automatically collect trace logs and human feedback to an Inference Table.  Use the notebook [`6_export_inference_table_to_logs`](M1_Sample_Code/6_export_inference_table_to_logs.py) to turn this Inference Table into a well-schemed `request_log` (with traces) and `assessment_log` with human feedback.

## 7. Request expert stakeholder input on logs

If you are unsure if a request/response from your deployed RAG Chain is correct or you got negative feedback on the request/response but are unsure why, you can use the Review App to request human feedback on requests from a deployed RAG chain.
